#   exit with zero status if it managed to merge them cleanly, or non-zero if
#   there were conflicts. When the driver crashes (e.g. killed by SEGV), it is
#   expected to exit with non-zero status that are higher than 128, and in such
#   a case, the merge results in a failure (which is different from producing a
#   conflict).
