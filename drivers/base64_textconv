#   The textconv config option is used to define a program for performing such a
#   conversion. The program should take a single argument, the name of a file to
#   convert, and produce the resulting text on stdout.

# in our case, the file in the worktree is already decoded, so we can just read
# that. Otherwise, git would compare the checked-in file, which is base64
# encoded
