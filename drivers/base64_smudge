#
#   A filter driver consists of a clean command and a smudge command, either of
#   which can be left unspecified. Upon checkout, when the smudge command is
#   specified, the command is fed the blob object from its standard input, and its
#   standard output is used to update the worktree file. Similarly, the clean
#   command is used to convert the contents of worktree file upon checkin

# in our case, we decode the base64 file stored in git

# path name is just for debugging, and set via configuration using the '%f'
# sequence (see docs). Configure as: smudge = ./base64_smudge %f
